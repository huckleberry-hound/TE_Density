# Densities


# Pipeline
Design for processing the gene / transposon files.

Input gene / transposon files, output density files.
Calculate the multiple TE densities for each gene, with a sweep of window values.

## Steps
The pipeline is a generic split / apply / combine.
Each density is independent, however, the densities are accumulated (summed) at the end.


0. Input gene / TE files; input window length
1. Preprocess
  - chunkify gene / TE based on chromosome
  - list sub-gene / sub-TE pairs
2. Split wrt gene names / Merge wrt TE overlap
  - for each sub-gene / sub-TE pair
    - for each window
      - start workers
      - request overlap for each gene name (handling failed requests!)
      - merge worker results (sums of overlaps )
      - calculate densities, write to file
