# Notes:
Michael, I have decided to stop switching Start and Stop for Genes that are on the negative strand (antisense) we will swap their upstream and downstream density values in a post processing manner.

Furthermore, I have decided that it is not important to worry about the antisense TEs. That would complicate things too much as we are primarily concerned about things in relation to a gene's orientation. Plus I am not convinced that the 'Start' and 'Stop' notation is relevant to the TE, as some TEs have identical inverted repeats on both edges, with the "important" domains being smack-dab in the center. 

# Requirements
Please install Pip so that you may easily install Python packages.
Then we will use Pip to go over our **requirements.txt** and install the needed Python packages.
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
