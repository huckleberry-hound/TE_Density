# OLD REPO
I am currently in the process of updating the pipeline to implement a number of speed improvements. I am also working on making this pipeline more universal. To view the old repository follow this [link](https://github.com/EdgerLab/TE_Density_Old)


# Notes:

# Requirements
Please install Pip so that you may easily install Python packages.
Then we will use Pip to go over our **requirements.txt** and install the needed Python packages.
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
