# Examples:
The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate the usage of the TE Density tool and some potential applications.

TE Density quantifies TE levels relative to each gene, upstream, intronically, and downstream, and relative to each TE type present in the annotation.

## Example 1:

## Example 2 - Relation of Gene Expression Values to TE Density:
The TE Density tool may be used to investigate the relationship between gene expression levels and TE presence. Here I will show how this may be done, using the [Northern Highbush Blueberry genome](https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/8/3/giz012/5304886#132456592) as a model.

### Step 1 - Generate TE Density Data for Blueberry Genome:
We are going to run TE Density here, which of course requires a gene and TE annotation. Acquiring the gene annotation is easy, it is located at **CITE**. First I needed to generate a suitable TE annotation, so I used EDTA **CITE**. More information can be found at EDTA's site **CITE** but I do include my options here within the file *xyz* **CITE**.

Then I run the TE Density script.
