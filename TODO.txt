# SCOTT, TODO 2020 03 22

- [X] implement chromosome id checks in unit/test_transposon_data.py
- [X] add test_Overlap.py tests for the Overlap class (similar to density tests)
- [ ] add to/from disk for GeneDatum
- [ ] add property for "chromosome_unique_id" to GeneDatum (probably copy paste from GeneData)
- [ ] add unit/test_gene_datum.py, implement GeneDatum.mock
- [ ] run flake8 and fix all problems:  `$ cd TE_Density; flake8`
        - fyi: flake8 warnings should be addressed, but `pylint` can *sometimes* be too scrutinous
- [ ] run `plyint` and fix most warnings
- [ ] add comments on magic numbers, like this:  # MAGIC NUMBER <explanation>
        - you don't need to do this to enums b/c an enum is used to store the constants,
          it's usage is defined, c.f. a random constant that only the author knows what it is
- [ ] read up on concepts:
        - Google Python Docstrings  https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html
        - Factory pattern (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern)
        - Interface Class (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_(computing))
        - Abstract Base Class (https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/abc.html) (@abstractmethod)
        - callable magic method `__call__`: (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/callable-in-python/)
        - profiling (https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html)
