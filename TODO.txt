# SCOTT, TODO 2020 02 17

- [ ] run flake8 and fix most problems:  `$ cd TE_Density; flake8`
        - I modified the flake8 config (`.flake8`) for 90 character limit
        - so you can pay attention to those erros now
        - this is up to you, pep8's limit of 79 is pretty stringent IMHO, just be consistent
- [ ] add comments on magic numbers, like this:  # MAGIC NUMBER <explanation>
- [ ] refactor rho calcs to not call `get_gene` more than needed
- [ ] read up on concepts:
        - Factory pattern (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern)
        - Interface Class (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_(computing))
        - Abstract Base Class (https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/abc.html) (@abstractmethod)
        - callable magic method `__call__`: (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/callable-in-python/)
- [ ] refactor `import_transposons.py::import_trasnsposons` for input arg
        - input callable for preprocessing instead so client doesn't have to modify the import
        - see the comments on that function
- [ ] add a system test for a client's usage of TE_Density (processing a new organism)
        - use this as an example for how to refactor TE_Density
        - you should be able to just import TE_Density and run it with the new data
        - that is, you should add the new preprocessing code and not have to modify TE_Density
- [ ] add a profiling test for GeneDatum accessing start/stop etc., then add memoization
