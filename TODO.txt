1. When importing the genes data, make it so that it is a function argument, lessen the amount of hard-coding

2. Check + 1

3. Delete Software column in TE and Gene importer

4. Multiprocessing for each chromosome?

5. Make sure the length for each gene is correct, need to make it the aggregate of all of the exons or should I just make it (stop - start + 1)???
